# IODD CLI
This is an application which uses IODD's product list to find festo products.
After selecting your choice on what product you want to get, the application will use selenium to automatically download the selected drivers using CLI
All you need to do is type this in the iodd folder :
>` python3 get_iodd.py "PRODUCT NAME" `

Just remember that you need to replace the product name with the actual product you are searching for
:joy:
